README file for HRUMC

LaTeX files for program for the Hudson River Undergraduate Mathematics 
Research Conference.

1) For the conference program:

Put abstracts one per file, using the stub.tex file, in the input/ 
subdirectory. I found it convenient to use the author's last name: 
input/hefferon.tex.  Enter them into this directory's hrumc2016.tex file
(make a copy, obviously, and call is hrumcxxxx.tex) like:
  \at{Ib}{hefferon}
to mean second time slot in the first parallel session. 

To get a printout without abstracts issue (from this directory):
  pdflatex hrumc2016
To get a printout with abstracts, do these four:
  pdflatex "\def\printabstracts{}\input{hrumc2016}"
  pdflatex "\def\printabstracts{}\input{hrumc2016}"
  makeindex -s hrumc.ist hrumc2016
  pdflatex "\def\printabstracts{}\input{hrumc2016}"

2) For registration and evaluation forms, 
  pdflatex registration

3) For a list of all abstracts, and for a .pdf of each abstract individually,
and for a list of documents to go in each room.
  cd input
  python3 ../bin/hrumc.py 
(that program takes the -h option to see the possibilities).
