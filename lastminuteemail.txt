We are very much looking forward to seeing you this Saturday at the 2016 Hudson River Undergraduate Mathematics Conference!  

The weather looks fine, and we have 120 short talks along with a plenary address by Scott Aaronson on the P versus NP Problem.  It will be a good time.


PROGRAMS

The full program is available at:

and the short program is at: 
  http://joshua.smcvt.edu/hrumc/hrumc2016short.pdf

Note: we will not provide printed programs.  (We are doing this out of a sense that many people prefer to have documents on their devices, as well as to save trees and money.)  If you want a printed program, please feel free to print one.  The short version saves paper by listing the talks and times but omitting the abstracts.  


DIRECTIONS

Get GPS directions for "1 College Parkway, Colchester, VT".

For the GPS challenged:

  *If you are coming from the south, take Interstate 89 to exit 15, bear right off of Exit 15, and get into left lane.
  * If you are coming from the north, take Interstate 89 to exit 16, turn right onto US 7 South toward the Winooski roundabout, and follow signs for Route 15 (4th exit off of roundabout). Follow Route 15 up the hill for approximately 1.5 miles, and get in the left lane. 

In either case, at the first set of lights, take a left into the parking lots. McCarthy Arts Center is on your right, Durick Library is straight ahead, Ross Sports Center and Tarrant Recreation Center are on the left toward the back of the lot. Turn left toward the Ross Sports Center. You can park in any lot. 

A campus map, which includes parking, is attached to this email and is on the back page of the program.
